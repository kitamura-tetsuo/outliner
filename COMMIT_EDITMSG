refactor(e2e): improve test environment detection in yjsService

- Enhance isTestEnvironment() detection with multiple fallback mechanisms
- Check import.meta.env.MODE for reliable build-time test detection
- Add localStorage flags (VITE_IS_TEST, VITE_E2E_TEST) for runtime E2E test detection
- Include window.__E2E__ property check for additional test environment detection
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing test infrastructure
