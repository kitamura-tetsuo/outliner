Fix E2E test timeouts by adding retry logic to SeedClient and failing fast on seed errors

- Added retry logic (3 attempts) to `SeedClient.seed` to handle transient network errors during server seeding.
- Updated `TestHelpers.createAndSeedProject` to throw an error immediately if seeding fails, preventing subsequent 120s timeouts in `navigateToProjectPage` and ensuring clearer failure reporting.
