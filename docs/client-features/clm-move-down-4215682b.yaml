title: Move down
shortcut: ↓
description: Moves the cursor one line down.
category: cursor-movement
status: implemented
acceptance:
- Moves the cursor one line down
- If on the last line and there is no next item, moves to the end of the same item
- If on the last line, moves to the first line of the next item. In this case, sets the cursor at the position with the smallest change in x-coordinate. It may move significantly if the number of characters is small. If no operations other than cursor up/down have been performed, sets the cursor at the position with small change from the x-coordinate where cursor down started.
- If not on the last line, moves to the line below in the same item
