title: Initializing and preparing the test environment
description: Improve environment preparation before test execution to increase test stability and reproducibility
category: testing
status: implemented
acceptance:
- Provide improved helper functions to solve DOM element detection issues
- Improve stability by creating data directly using Fluid API instead of UI operations
- Provide a mechanism to automatically create projects and pages before test execution
- Provide helper functions to initialize the test environment in a consistent way
- Reduce dependencies between tests so that each test can run independently
tests:
- client/e2e/basic.spec.ts
- client/e2e/helpers.ts
- client/e2e/utils/linkTestHelpers.ts
- client/e2e/utils/testHelpers.ts
- client/src/tests/integration/homepage-auth.integration.spec.ts
- client/src/tests/integration/tst-initializing-and-preparing-the-test-environment-b55298f7.integration.spec.ts
notes:
- Use helper functions with retry capability to stabilize tests as element detection may be unstable in the test environment
- Use Fluid API for test data creation to improve test stability instead of UI operations
- Standardize environment preparation before tests to reduce dependencies between tests
