title: Improve your test environment
description: Improvements to increase the stability and reliability of the test environment
category: testing
status: implemented
acceptance:
- Provide helper functions for detecting and manipulating DOM elements
- Extend timeout settings during test execution to improve test stability
- Adjust test conditions considering test environment constraints
- Provide alternatives when mouse events do not work accurately
- Extend timeout settings for element detection waiting to improve test stability
tests:
- client/e2e/core/lnk-backlink-function-7976aef8.spec.ts
- client/e2e/core/tst-improve-your-test-environment-72a51b65.spec.ts
notes:
- Use dedicated helper functions to stabilize tests as mouse events and DOM element detection may be unstable in the test environment
- Provide alternative means as some functions may not work properly when running in headless mode
