title: Move up
shortcut: ↑
description: Moves the cursor one line up.
category: cursor-movement
status: implemented
acceptance:
- If not on the first line, moves to the line above in the same item
- If on the first line and there is no previous item, moves to the beginning of the same item
- If on the first line, moves to the last line of the previous item. In this case, sets the cursor at the position with the smallest change in x-coordinate. It may move significantly if the number of characters is small. If no operations other than cursor up/down have been performed, sets the cursor at the position with small change from the x-coordinate where cursor up started.
- Moves the cursor one line up
