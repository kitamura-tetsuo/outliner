title: VS Code style clipboard behavior
category: text-formatting
status: implemented
description: 'Copying and pasting using multi-cursors or box selection should behave the same as Visual Studio Code. Metadata in the clipboard is interpreted so each cursor receives the expected text.

'
acceptance:
  - Box selection paste inserts each line of text into the corresponding selection range
  - Clipboard operations work when triggered via keyboard shortcuts
  - Pasting with application/vscode-editor metadata distributes text across multiple cursors
tests:
  - client/e2e/core/fmt-vscode-clipboard-behavior-3807f353.spec.ts
