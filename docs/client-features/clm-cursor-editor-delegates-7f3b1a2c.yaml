description: 'The primary editing shortcuts are routed through the new CursorEditor class.

  Users can insert characters, delete text, and split items while staying on the

  same page without losing cursor state.

status: implemented
acceptance:
- Backspace and Delete remove characters via the delegated editor logic.
