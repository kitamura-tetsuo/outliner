title: ESLint Candidates Detection Script
description: 'Added ESLint Detection Script that identifies files ready for rule promotion from warn to error level.

  The script scans the codebase to find files with zero violations for specified ESLint rules,

  helping developers systematically promote rules from "warn" to "error" severity.

  '
details: "- **New Script**: `scripts/detect-promote-candidates.js`\n  - Command-line interface for identifying ESLint rule promotion candidates\n  - Supports batch processing to avoid command-line length limits\n  - Prioritizes files based on modification date and location importance\n  - Generates detailed JSON reports with proposed changes\n\n- **Key Features**:\n  - Configurable rule checking with `--rules` parameter\n  - Maximum file limit with `--max-files` parameter\n  - Dry-run mode to preview changes without making them\n  - Exclusion patterns for test files, node_modules, etc.\n  - Priority scoring based on file recency and importance\n\n- **Test Infrastructure**:\n  - Added comprehensive test coverage in `scripts/tests/detect-promote-candidates.spec.ts`\n  - Integration with existing test framework (Vitest)\n  - Validates script functionality and output format\n\n- **Dependencies**:\n  - Updated scripts/package.json with required dependencies\n  - Package-lock.json updated to reflect new dependencies\n\n- **Usage Example**:\n  ```bash\n  node scripts/detect-promote-candidates.js --rules \"no-console,no-unused-vars\" --max-files 20\n  ```\n\n- **Output**:\n  - Console display of promotion candidates\n  - JSON artifact file saved with timestamp: `promote-candidates-<timestamp>.json`\n  - Structured data including file paths, rules, and priority scores\n"
benefits: '- Automates identification of files ready for stricter ESLint rules

  - Reduces manual code review effort for rule promotion

  - Provides data-driven approach to improving code quality

  - Integrates with existing development workflow

  '
test_coverage: '- Unit tests for core functions

  - Integration tests with actual ESLint execution

  - Validation of command-line argument parsing

  - Verification of exclusion pattern handling
