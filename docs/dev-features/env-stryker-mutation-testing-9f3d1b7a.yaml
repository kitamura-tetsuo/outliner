title: Enable Stryker mutation testing
title-ja: Strykerによるミューテーションテストの導入
description: |
  Add Stryker configuration, dependencies, and npm scripts so developers can run mutation testing with Vitest.
  GitHub Actions execute incremental mutation testing on pull requests (limited to changed lines) and
  a nightly full-suite run whenever commits land on main, both pinned to self-hosted Linux runners.
  Each run uploads HTML artifacts and publishes a markdown summary generated from the JSON report, while
  the internal schedule dashboard surfaces cadence and last-run timestamps for verification.
