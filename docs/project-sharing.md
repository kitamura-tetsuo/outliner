# Project Settings and Sharing

This document describes how to manage project settings and share projects with other users.

## Accessing Project Settings

## Sharing a Project

You can invite other users to join your project by generating a unique invitation link.

### How to Generate an Invitation Link

   - Note: You must be the project owner or have sufficient permissions.
4. A unique link will be generated and displayed.
5. Click the **Copy** button to copy the link to your clipboard.

### Joining a Shared Project

1. The recipient receives the invitation link (e.g., `https://your-app-url/share/TOKEN`).
2. Open the link in a browser.
3. If not logged in, the user will be prompted to log in.
4. Once logged in, the user will be automatically added to the project and redirected to the project page.

## Notes

- Anyone with the link can join the project, so share it carefully.
