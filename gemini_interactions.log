      Issue Number: 321
      Issue Title: Auto-add sibling item when editing the bottommost entry
      Issue Body:
      ---
      Summary

  Add logic so that when a user edits or types in the last visible item on a page, a new empty sibling item is automatically appended beneath it. This ensures there is always one empty item available for further input.

  Requirements

      Detect when input or editing occurs on the item currently at the bottom of the page.

      Upon detection, insert a new sibling item immediately after the edited item.

      The newly created item should behave like any other item (selectable, editable, deletable).

      The behavior must work regardless of how the user reaches the bottom item (keyboard navigation, mouse click, etc.).

  Implementation Notes

      Review OutlinerItem.svelte and associated stores for existing item-addition behavior.

      Ensure cursor handling continues to respect the guidelines in Cursor.ts and EditorOverlay.svelte.

      Avoid duplicating Firebase initialization and follow the repository’s style conventions (prefer undefined over null, keep $effect blocks short).

      Document the new behavior in docs/client-features according to the feature naming rules in AGENTS.md.

      Confirm that a project or page is created programmatically via fluidClient when needed.

  E2E Testing

      Write detailed Playwright tests covering this new functionality.

      Run each test spec one at a time using scripts/run-e2e-progress-for-codex.sh 1.

      It is acceptable if these tests time out in the CI environment; they will be executed elsewhere.

      Keep each test file under ~150 lines, and verify visibility of new items using expect(locator).toBeVisible().

  Acceptance Criteria

      Editing the bottommost item automatically inserts a new item below it.

      The new item can be edited and behaves identically to other items.

      E2E tests exist that demonstrate this behavior.

      Documentation for the feature is added to docs/client-features.
